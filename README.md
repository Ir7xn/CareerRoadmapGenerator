## üîß How to Operate (Generating a Roadmap)

The generator is designed for a seamless, three-step user experience to deliver a highly customized career plan.

### **Step 1: Define Your Starting Point**

1.  Navigate to the main page of the application (`http://localhost:3000`).
2.  In the first input field, enter your **Current Skills** (e.g., *Python, SQL, HTML, basic Java*). Use commas or spaces to separate skills.
3.  In the second input field, enter your **Current Education/Experience Level** (e.g., *Junior Developer, recent graduate, self-taught*).

### **Step 2: Define Your Goal**

1.  In the third input field, clearly state your **Desired Career Goal** (e.g., *Senior Data Scientist, Cloud Security Engineer, UX/UI Designer*). The more specific you are, the better the result.
2.  (Optional) Specify any constraints or long-term goals in the final input field (e.g., *Must be a remote job, focus on cloud tools, or target a management role in 5 years*).

### **Step 3: Generate and Review**

1.  Click the **"Generate Roadmap"** button.
2.  The application will send your inputs to the Gemini API, which will analyze the data against industry standards and generate a comprehensive career plan.
3.  The results will display a **5-stage roadmap** visualization:
    * **Phase 1 (Foundations):** Focuses on core, domain-specific prerequisites.
    * **Phases 2-4 (Core Growth):** Outlines essential tools, technologies, and project milestones.
    * **Phase 5 (Specialization):** Targets advanced concepts to reach a senior/expert level.
4.  Each phase will contain **3-4 minimal, actionable tasks** to guide your next steps.
